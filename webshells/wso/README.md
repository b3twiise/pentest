# WARNING !

This is a Copy of the WSO webshell made by @Hardlinux @Twelp that got eliminated from github.

This is a real hacking Webshell widely used by hackers to backdoor hacked websites, it's flawed as malware by almost every AV and probably your webhosting service will delete the file ASAP, so you need to encode it with a PHP service, with `base64` or other method.

All WSO 4.2.5 password is `admin`
404 WSO 2.4 password is `404`

You can change it in the code.

I am not the original author of this webshell this is a backup repo. Be aware of this.

If you need any help or want your modded webshell to be added here, open an issue.

# Files description

* `wso_v_4.2.5.php` is the latest master known in the original repo. It has a `Watching webshell!` part that will email the link of the webshell when used for the first time.
* `wso_v_4.2.5-non-backdored` > WSO 4.2.5 latest, it's the same file but without the email function.
* `WSO(2.4)_with_error_404_hidden` is an OLD webshell that got modified to show a 404 Error, it has a hidden password field use `TAB` to type in it.
