General guidance:
    - Ensure NICs are on the channel you are trying to monitor
    - Try to be at least 1 meter from a target or the access point
    - Have patience, airpwn-ng is based on the race condition presented by TCP
        - As such, airpwn-ng is not a 100% solution, sometimes it wins, sometimes it doesn't


Open Access Point guidance:
    - Open Access Points require only 1 NIC
    - Drop desired NIC to monitor mode
    - Switch to proper channel
    - Example syntax:
        - ./airpwn-ng -m <monitor mode NIC> -i <monitor mode NIC> --inject payloads/wargames


WEP Access Point guidance:
    - WEP Access Points require only 1 NIC
    - Drop desired NIC to monitor mode
    - Switch to proper channel
    - Example syntax:
        - ./airpwn-ng -m <monitor mode NIC> -i <monitor mode NIC> --wep '<WEP password>' --bssid '<BSSID of Access Point>' --inject payloads/wargames


WPA Access Point guidance:
    - WPA Access Points currently require 2 NICs
        - The need for a 2nd physical NIC can be avoided by using the --elite flag for airmon-ng
        - Example syntax:
            - airmon-ng --elite start wlan0
            - This leaves you with wlan0 and wlan0mon
            - wlan0 will be our injection NIC
            - wlan0mon will be our monitor NIC
    - Connect whatever NIC you choose to the Access Point
        - This will be the NIC for -i
    - Switch your monitoring NIC to the same channel as the Access Point
        - This will be the NIC for -m
    - As airpwn-ng doesn't currently have a method for monitor mode injection to WPA, we must add the --inj flag
    - Example syntax:
        - ./airpwn-ng -m <monitor mode NIC> -i <injection NIC> --inj man --wpa '<WPA password>' --bssid '<BSSID of Access Point>' --essid '<ESSID of Access Point>' --inject payloads/wargames
