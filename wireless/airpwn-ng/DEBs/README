In this directory you will find pre-made .debs.  Building libtins and dot11decrypt, while trivial, can sometimes be "trying"...

So, we did the hardwork for you and built the .debs; feel free to use them or do it yourself.

What we don't want to hear, is folks complaining that our .debs are not built the "proper" way.  If you don't like how we did it, do it yourself.

In src/ you will find the master files downloaded from github on 15 January 2017; from there we built.

This is a new structure and work in progress, so only the 64-bit versions should be considered as the "latest and greatest".  While the other architectures should work, do not consider them "solid" until they have been rebuilt accordingly.
