# Deprecation Notice

At Defcon 26 we talked about how we're deprecating mana-toolkit in favour of [bettercap](http://bettercap.org) and [berate-ap](https://github.com/sensepost/berate_ap). The core of mana, [hostapd-mana](https://github.com/sensepost/hostapd-mana) is still under active development. This repo isn't going anywhere, and can still be used, but it hasn't been actively maintained for some time. Keep an eye on [w1f1.net](https://w1f1.net/) for more info.

# tl;dr
Logging issues here is unlikely to get your problem solved.
